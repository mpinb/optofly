# Calibration

## Visual Stimuli Calibration

The visual stimuli system needs to know how fly heading (from Braid tracking) maps to pixel positions on the display. Two steps are required.

### Step 1: Screen Identification

Identifies which physical screen corresponds to which display port.

```bash
python -m src.processes.visual --calibrate
```

Labels appear on each screen showing "Screen 1", "Screen 2", etc. with display port names. Identify which screen is North/East/South/West in your arena, then press ESC. Update `screen_mapping` in `visual_stimuli.toml` if needed.

### Step 2: Heading-to-Pixel Mapping

Creates a mapping from Braid tracking coordinates to screen pixel positions.

```bash
python -m src.processes.visual --calibrate-mapping
```

For each of the 4 calibration positions (one per screen):
1. A red circle appears at the calibration position
2. Place a tracked object in the arena so it faces directly toward the circle
3. Note the object's x, y coordinates from the Braid browser interface
4. Enter those values when prompted in the terminal
5. Press Enter to advance to the next position

**Output files:**

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `calibrations/heading_mapping_data.csv` | Raw calibration data (pixel_x, braid_x, braid_y) |
| `calibrations/heading_mapping_model.npz` | Interpolation model used at runtime |

**Apply calibration in `config.toml`:**
```toml
[visual_stimuli]
calibration_mapping_file = "calibrations/heading_mapping_model.npz"
use_empirical_calibration = true
```

### Step 3: Verify Calibration

```bash
python -m src.processes.visual --test-calibration
```

A red circle sweeps clockwise around all screens. Verify:
- The circle moves smoothly from screen to screen
- Direction labels match your physical arrangement
- The circle wraps at the edges (South edge connects to West edge)

Controls: SPACE (pause/resume), LEFT/RIGHT (manual adjust when paused), R (reset to 0), ESC (exit).

### Calibration Theory

**Coordinate systems:**

- Braid space: (x, y, z) in meters, heading = `arctan2(yvel, xvel)`, origin at arena center
- Display space: (0, 0) at bottom-left, (7680, 1080) at top-right, four 1920x1080 screens, cylindrical wrap

The calibration builds a lookup table: `Braid heading (radians) → Screen pixel X`. At runtime, `GeometryUtils.heading_to_pixel_x()` linearly interpolates between calibration points.

### Manual Calibration File

If you need to create a calibration file manually:

```csv
pixel_x,braid_x,braid_y
0,-0.05,0.02
640,-0.04,0.03
```

The `.npz` model contains two arrays:
- `headings`: sorted heading values in radians
- `pixels`: corresponding pixel X positions

## Liquid Lens Calibration

Maps fly z-position (meters) to lens focal power (diopters) so the lens tracks focus as the fly moves vertically.

### Prerequisites

- Lens connected and serial port confirmed (default: `/dev/ttyUSB1`)
- Braid running with a tracked object visible
- OptoFly environment activated

### Procedure

1. Place a target at a known height in the arena and note its z-coordinate from Braid.

2. Connect to the lens and switch to focal power mode:

   ```python
   from src.hardware.lens import LensDriver
   lens = LensDriver(port="/dev/ttyUSB1")
   lens.to_focal_power_mode()
   ```

3. Adjust diopters until the target is in focus:

   ```python
   lens.set_diopter(2.0)  # adjust as needed
   ```

4. Record the `(z, dpt)` pair.

5. Repeat across the full z-range of your arena (at least 5-10 points).

6. Write the collected data to `calibrations/liquid_lens.csv`:

   ```csv
   z,dpt
   0.05,2.3
   0.10,1.9
   0.15,1.5
   ```

### Configuration

Enable the lens and point to the calibration file in `config.toml`:

```toml
[liquid_lens]
active = true
port = "/dev/ttyUSB1"
calibration_file = "calibrations/liquid_lens.csv"
```

### How It Works

At startup, `LensCalibration` fits a degree-2 polynomial to the CSV data and builds a 1000-point lookup table. During tracking, `get_dpt(z)` performs a nearest-neighbor lookup to convert fly z-position to a diopter value in real time.

### Troubleshooting

- **Serial port not found**: run `ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*` and check permissions with `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB1`
- **Lens not responding**: verify the handshake by running `LensDriver` interactively with `debug=True`
- **Poor focus across z-range**: add more calibration points, especially at the extremes
